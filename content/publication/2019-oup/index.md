abstract: From emails to social media, from instant messaging to political memes,
  the way we produce and transmit culture is radically changing. Understanding the
  consequences of the massive diffusion of digital media is of the utmost importance,
  both from the intellectual and the social point of view. 'Cultural Evolution in
  the Digital Age' proposes that a specific discipline - cultural evolution - provides
  an excellent framework to analyse our digital age. Cultural evolution is a vibrant,
  interdisciplinary, and increasingly productive scientific framework that aims to
  provide a naturalistic and quantitative explanation of culture. In the book the
  author shows how cultural evolution offers both a sophisticated view of human behaviour,
  grounded in cognitive science and evolutionary theory, and a strong quantitative
  and experimental methodology. The book examines in depth various topics that directly
  originate from the application of cultural evolution research to digital media.
  Is online social influence radically different from previous forms of social influence?
  Do digital media amplify the effects of popularity and celebrity influence? What
  are the psychological forces that favour the spread of online misinformation? What
  are the effects of the hyper-availability of information online on cultural cumulation?
  The cultural evolutionary perspective provides novel insights, and a relatively
  encouraging take on the overall effects of our online activities on our culture.Cultural
  Evolution is an area of rapidly growing interest, and this timely book will be important
  reading for students and researchers in the fields of psychology, anthropology,
  cognitive science, and the media.
